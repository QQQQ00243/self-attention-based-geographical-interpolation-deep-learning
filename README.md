## Introduction
Inferring and delineating the subsurface stratigraphy of unexplored areas in deep sea remains a challenging problem. This is mainly due to insufficient prior geological knowledge, the inherent complexity of stratigraphy, and spatial variability coupled with the scarcity of drilling boreholes. For existing deep-learning approaches, it is possible to learn the mapping between sparse borehole data and stratigraphic structures while the solution quality largely depends on the prior physics knowledge and proper setting of hyperparameters. Self-attention-based geographical interpolation deep learning (GIDL) framework is developed to facilitate learning of highly complex stratigraphic structures in sparse borehole regions.
